## üìÅ Featured Projects

 I've curated a selection of my work on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/wildiney). You'll find a diverse range of projects, from graphic design to mobile apps, showcasing my product design and development skills.

## üåü Skills

### Product Design

As a Product Designer, I combine **user-centered** and **data-driven** design methods to create solutions that balance user needs and business goals. My expertise includes:

- **User-Centered Design**: Understanding user behavior and needs to inform intuitive design decisions.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Using data and metrics to validate ideas, measure outcomes, and optimize product features.
- **Prototyping**: Developing interactive prototypes to validate concepts and gather feedback.
- **Collaboration**: Working closely with cross-functional teams to align design with product strategy.

### Development

I leverage my development skills to enhance product functionality and user experience. My areas of expertise include:

- **Front-end Development**: Building responsive and engaging interfaces that delight users.
- **Mobile App Development**: Designing and implementing applications for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Automation**: Streamlining processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual tasks.

### Data Science

I utilize data science skills to analyze metrics and drive product decisions. My expertise includes:

- **Data Analysis**: Evaluating user data to inform design and development strategies.
- **Metric Evaluation**: Using data to measure the impact of design changes and product features.
- **A/B Testing**: Conducting experiments to optimize user experience and improve engagement.

## üé® Design Philosophy

I believe that **if you can design one thing, you can design everything**. My approach combines both **user-centered** and **data-driven** design methodologies, ensuring that each product is not only intuitive and accessible but also informed by data and metrics. By balancing creativity with analysis, I strive to create designs that are adaptable, scalable, and effective across different mediums and contexts.
